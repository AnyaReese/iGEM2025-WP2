                                <p>We have selected the SHuffle T7-B strain as the chassis organism. The commercial SHuffle T7-B strain is derived from Escherichia coli BL21. According to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the risk level of E. coli B strain is classified as Risk Group 1 (RG-1). This indicates that the B strain typically does not cause disease in healthy adults and is considered a microorganism with low individual and environmental risk.</p>
                                <p>The SHuffle strain originates from the non-pathogenic E. coli BL21 and lacks common virulence factors. Additionally, the primary pathogenic substance of E. coli, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, also known as endotoxin), cannot penetrate the intact cornea. LPS can only diffuse into the stromal layer when the cornea is damaged, and this process is mainly mediated by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) that migrate to the damaged tissue. Therefore, no additional modification of LPS is required in this project.<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup> Moreover, the eye is an immune-privileged site, which further reduces the risk of severe infection.</p>
                                <p>Regarding the risk of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), although engineered bacteria carrying plasmids could theoretically transfer resistance genes through conjugation, this requires specific conditions and is extremely unlikely in our application scenario.</p>

                                <p>Encapsulated in Hydrogels, the Engineered Bacteria Rely on Nutrients in Tears to Survive, and Their Viability and Reproduction Rate are Influenced by Factors such as the Ocular Microenvironment Temperature and Nutrient Elements. When the Bacterial Viability Declines and the Risk of Lysis Occurs, We Need to Promptly Generate a Reporting Signal to Alert Users to Replace the Contact Lenses. To This End, We Have Designed a Biosafety Reporting Module.</p>
                                <p>This module utilizes the fluorescent protein Crimson as the reporting signal and implements fluorescence signal detection by incorporating a light source device into the contact lens care box. The fluorescence signal intensity is proportional to the expression intensity of RNF114, and we will determine the safety grade corresponding to the fluorescence signal intensity through experiments.</p>
                                <p>The Crimson fluorescent protein is characterized by its high brightness, low toxicity, non-aggregating properties, and excellent photostability. Studies have shown that the expression of Crimson in neurons not only exhibits higher brightness than other common red fluorescent proteins (such as mCherry and mKate2), but also demonstrates significantly lower cytotoxicity during long-term expression. Moreover, Crimson does not aggregate within cells, which further reduces the potential interference with cellular functions.</p>
                                <p>By leveraging the naturally occurring polycistronic structure in prokaryotes, we achieve synchronous expression of RNF114 and the fluorescent protein Crimson. The two coding genes share a single promoter, and after translation, the two coding genes are located on the same mRNA, thereby enabling synchronous expression of the two genes.</p>

                                <p>In the polycistronic structure, the ribosome binding site (RBS) affects the reading of the open reading frame (ORF) through its complementarity to the ribosome and its distance from the start codon. We have designed RBS of varying strengths for the two coding genes to achieve relatively higher expression levels of RNF114, thereby directing translational resources primarily towards the expression of the target therapeutic molecule.</p>
                                <p>We have integrated the fluorescence signal detection device into a black contact lens care box. Upon pressing the button, the light source excites the fluorescent protein Crimson, and the fluorescence intensity emitted by the protein is detected by the BH1750 sensor. The safety grade warning is determined based on the preset threshold and displayed on the LCD screen. (See detail in <a href="./drylab/hardware.html">Hardware Part</a>)</p>

                                            <p>In this system, we use the nutrient-deficient SHuffle T7-B strain as the engineered bacterial strain and design a metabolic complementarity-based symbiotic bacterial system, ensuring that bacteria A and B can only coexist and cannot survive independently. Bacteria A cannot synthesize tryptophan (Trp) but can provide histidine (His), while bacteria B cannot synthesize histidine (His) but can provide tryptophan (Trp). These two bacteria must provide the required amino acids for each other to maintain growth; they cannot survive independently due to the lack of essential nutrients.</p>
                                            <p>We knocked out the trpA gene in bacteria A to prevent it from synthesizing tryptophan, and knocked out the hisG gene in bacteria B to prevent it from synthesizing histidine. Meanwhile, bacteria A overexpress hisG to help provide histidine to bacteria B, and bacteria B overexpress trpA to help provide tryptophan to bacteria A. A strict metabolic symbiosis is formed between bacteria A and B; they can only grow in a coexistence state. If separated, they will lose their viability due to nutrient deficiencies.</p>
                                            <p>This system is expected to ensure that after the failure of the hydrogel's confinement of the engineered bacteria, the bacteria will die due to the lack of essential amino acids, preventing them from spreading to the eye or the natural environment.</p>

                                                <h6>1.1.1 In the trp synthesis pathway, there are four types of enzymes:</h6>
                                                <ul>

                                                <p>Next, we designed two primers to amplify the gRNA targeting trpC, adding Bsal restriction sites at both ends.</p>

                                                <p>The aroG gene encodes 3-deamino-D-aromatic amino acid transaminase (DAHP synthase). This enzyme is a key enzyme in the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway, involved in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids (such as tryptophan and phenylalanine). In normal metabolic processes, the activity of DAHP synthase is subject to feedback inhibition by its product (tryptophan). In other words, when the concentration of tryptophan is too high, it inhibits the activity of the enzyme encoded by aroG, thereby reducing the synthesis of aromatic amino acids.</p>
                                                
                                                <p>We modified the aroG gene by mutating the aspartic acid (Asp) at position 146 to asparagine (Asn) (i.e., D146N mutation). This removed the feedback inhibition of tryptophan on the enzyme. The enzyme's activity is no longer inhibited by high concentrations of tryptophan, so even if there is a high concentration of tryptophan in the cells, DAHP synthase can still continue to catalyze the synthesis of aromatic amino acids, avoiding metabolic pathway blockage due to feedback inhibition.</p>
                                                
                                                <p>We added an RBS to the front of its CDS sequence to facilitate the formation of a polycistronic transcript with the enzymes related to Trp synthesis, allowing for simultaneous expression. We also added SalI and NotI restriction enzyme recognition sites at both ends to facilitate insertion into a subvector.</p>

                                                <p>To maintain a high phosphate concentration around the engineered bacteria, we chose Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate - methacrylate copolymer - hyaluronic acid - β-cyclodextrin) hydrogel for loading. Since phosphate carries a negative charge in the hydrogel environment, the long-chain hyaluronic acid (HA), which also has a negative charge, can strongly restrict its diffusion. Additionally, the β-cyclodextrin in the hydrogel composition has a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic outer surface, making it an effective storage material for phosphate.</p>
                                                <p>As for the phosphate concentration in the hydrogel, data shows that the phosphate concentration in the eye is typically similar to that in physiological fluids, around 0.8–1.5 mmol/L. Phosphate concentrations in soil vary widely, typically ranging from 0.001–0.1 mmol/L. In natural water bodies, phosphate concentrations are generally low, around 1.05 × 10⁻⁷ - 5.25 × 10⁻⁷ mol/L (corresponding to 0.01–0.05 mg/L P). In eutrophic water sources, the phosphate concentration is roughly between 8.34 × 10⁻⁷ mol/L and 8.34 × 10⁻⁶ mol/L.</p>
                                                <p>We aim to load the hydrogel with a phosphate concentration higher than all the concentrations mentioned above, while ensuring it does not irritate the eye, even considering the dilution effect of tears.</p>
